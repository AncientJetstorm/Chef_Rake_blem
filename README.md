# Rake_blem

	Bit of messing around
	Creating a simple Splunk app/dashboard from config.yaml
	Open config file and fill out first line using example and other lines as small reference, all references should be used as the grammer shows.
	Add more lines like the first one after it for more elements to be added to the dash, using Double or Triple puts elements on the same row, they must be back-to-back used (if the first element is Double, then the second should be aswell)

	After the config file is filled out, cd to the location and run rake.
	The folder for the app will be created along with the .spl version to be uploaded to Splunk.
	You will need to restart Splunk after it is installed.
